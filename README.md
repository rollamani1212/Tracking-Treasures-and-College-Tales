Tracking Treasures And College Tales

A Lost & Found Management Platform designed for college campuses to streamline the process of reporting, retrieving, and managing lost items. The system connects students who lose belongings with those who find them, reducing inefficiencies of traditional lost-and-found offices and promoting a more connected campus community.

üìñ Project Overview

Managing lost and found items in colleges often relies on bulletin boards, offices, or scattered online posts, which are inefficient, outdated, and inconvenient. This project introduces a centralized digital platform where:
Students can report lost items with descriptions and images.
Finders can submit found items and connect with rightful owners.
Administrators can validate and manage posts through a dedicated dashboard.
The system ensures security, scalability, and inclusivity while providing a smooth and user-friendly experience for students and staff alike.
